# React App which includes forms and form Validation

Created a React form with validation for required fields without using third party libraries.
It displays error messages.
Does not take submission until fields are filled correctly. 
Shows all the filled details on a new route post-successful submission. 
Fields required: First Name, Last Name, Username, E-mail, password (show/hide), PhoneNo. (country code ____ number), country (dropdown), city (dropdown), Pan No. & Aadhar No.
